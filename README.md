# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🚀  
I am Amritpal Singh, a Data Analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. Skilled in Power BI, SQL (SQL Server, MySQL & PostgreSQL), Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), Excel, and cloud platforms, such as AWS and Azure, I thrive on uncovering patterns and driving data-driven decision-making.
