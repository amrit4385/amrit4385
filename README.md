# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🚀  
I am Amritpal Singh, a Data Analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. Skilled in Power BI, SQL (SQL Server, MySQL & PostgreSQL), Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), Excel, and cloud platforms, such as AWS and Azure, I thrive on uncovering patterns and driving data-driven decision-making.

My journey in data analytics began with my experience as a Senior Systems Engineer, where I worked as a Data Analyst in the retail and healthcare sectors. I am also certified in PMP and SAFe Scrum Master, which enhances my ability to lead and collaborate on data-driven projects.

Holding a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Project Management from Humber College, I bring a blend of technical expertise, analytical thinking, and project management skills to the field of data analytics.

        institution looking to launch a new line of credit cards. Using Microsoft Excel and Power BI, I performed data cleaning, transformation, 
        and modeling with Power Query, ETL methodologies, and DAX to extract insights. The analysis was structured across five key areas—
        Demographic Overview, Income Analysis, Spending Trends, Additional Insights, and Executive View—helping refine credit card strategies 
        to enhance adoption and optimize financial performance.
