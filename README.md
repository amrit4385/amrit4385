# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🚀  
I am Amritpal Singh, a Data Analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. Skilled in Power BI, SQL (SQL Server, MySQL & PostgreSQL), Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), Excel, and cloud platforms, such as AWS and Azure, I thrive on uncovering patterns and driving data-driven decision-making.

My journey in data analytics began with my experience as a Senior Systems Engineer, where I worked as a Data Analyst in the retail and healthcare sectors. I am also certified in PMP and SAFe Scrum Master, which enhances my ability to lead and collaborate on data-driven projects.

Holding a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Project Management from Humber College, I bring a blend of technical expertise, analytical thinking, and project management skills to the field of data analytics.
