# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🚀  
I am Amritpal Singh, a Data Analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. Skilled in Power BI, SQL (SQL Server, MySQL & PostgreSQL), Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), Excel, and cloud platforms, such as AWS and Azure, I thrive on uncovering patterns and driving data-driven decision-making.

My journey in data analytics began with my experience as a Senior Systems Engineer, where I worked as a Data Analyst in the retail and healthcare sectors. I am also certified in PMP and SAFe Scrum Master, which enhances my ability to lead and collaborate on data-driven projects.

Holding a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Project Management from Humber College, I bring a blend of technical expertise, analytical thinking, and project management skills to the field of data analytics.

Feel free to explore my repositories, connect with me for collaborations, or just say Hi! Let’s turn data into impactful insights together. 🚀
